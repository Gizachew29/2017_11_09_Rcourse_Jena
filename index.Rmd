# Preface 

This course material is aimed at people who are already familiar with
the R language and syntax, and who would like to get a hands-on
introduction to machine learning. 

## Installation

We will install required packages as we go along. Before the course,
participants should install a recent version of
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) (ideally the current release version)
and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), or any other
editor of their choice.
