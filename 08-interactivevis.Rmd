# Interactive visualisation

## Interactivity graphs 

> This section is based on the on-line [`ggvis` documentation](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/)

The goal of ggvis is to make it easy to build interactive graphics for
exploratory data analysis. [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/) has a
similar underlying theory to `ggplot2` (the grammar of graphics), but
it's expressed a little differently, and adds new features to make
your plots interactive. [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/) also
incorporates shiny's reactive programming model and `dplyr`'s grammar
of data transformation.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("ggvis")
sml <- sample(nrow(surveys), 1e3)
surveys_sml <- surveys_complete[sml, ]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- ggvis(surveys_sml, x = ~weight, y = ~hindfoot_length)
p %>% layer_points()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
surveys_sml %>%
    ggvis(x = ~weight, y = ~hindfoot_length,
          fill = ~species_id) %>%
    layer_points()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p %>% layer_points(fill = ~species_id)
p %>% layer_points(shape = ~species_id)
```

To set fixed plotting parameters, use `:=`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p %>% layer_points(fill := "red", stroke := "black")
p %>% layer_points(size := 300, opacity := 0.4)
p %>% layer_points(shape := "cross")
```

### Interactivity

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p %>% layer_points(
          size := input_slider(10, 100),
          opacity := input_slider(0, 1))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p %>%
    layer_points() %>% 
    add_tooltip(function(df) df$weight)
```

* `input_slider()`
* `input_checkbox()`
* `input_checkboxgroup()`
* `input_numeric()`
* `input_radiobuttons()`
* `input_select()`
* `input_text()`

See the
[interactivity vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/interactivity.html)
for details.


### Layers

**Simple layers** 

* `layer_points()`, with properties x, y, shape, stroke, fill,
  strokeOpacity, fillOpacity, and opacity.
* `layer_paths()`, for paths and polygons (using the fill argument).
* `layer_ribbons()` for filled areas.
* `layer_rects()`, `layer_text()`.

**Compound layers**, which which combine data transformations with one
or more simple layers.

* `layer_lines()` which automatically orders by the x variable with
  `arrange()`.
* `layer_histograms()` and `layer_freqpolys()`, which first bin the
  data with `compute_bin()`.
* `layer_smooths()`, which fits and plots a smooth model to the data
  using `compute_smooth()`.

See the [layers vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/layers.html) for
details.


Like for `ggplot2`'s geoms, we can overly multiple layers:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
p %>%
    layer_points() %>%
    layer_smooths(stroke := "red")
```

### More components 

* `scales`, to control the mapping between data and visual properties;
  see the
  [properties and scales vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/properties-scales.html).

* `legends` and `axes` to control the appearance of the guides
  produced by the scales. See the
  [axes and legends vignette](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/axes-legends.html).


### Challenge

> Apply a PCA analysis on the `iris` data, and use `ggvis` to
> visualise that data along PC1 and PC2, controlling the point size
> using a slide bar.

## Interactive apps 

> This section is based on RStudio `shiny` tutorials.

From the [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
package [website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/):

> Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web
> apps straight from R.

When using [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), one tends to aim for
more complete, long-lasting applications, rather then *simply* and
transient visualisations.

A [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application is composed of a
*ui* (user interface) and a server that exchange information using a
programming paradigm called *reactive programming*: changes performed
by the user to the *ui* trigger a reaction by the *server* and the
output is updated accordingly.

Before looking at the details of such an architecture, let's build a
simple example from scratch. This app, shown below, uses the
`faithful` data, describing the wainting time between eruptions and
the duration of the reuption for the Old Faithful geyser in
Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. 

```{r faithfuldata}
head(faithful)
```

It shows the distribution of waiting times along a histogram (produced
by the `hist` function) and provides a slider to adjust the number of
bins (the `breaks` argument to `hist`).

```{r shinyapp1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://lgatto.shinyapps.io/shiny-app1/",
                   height = "650px")
```

### Creation of our fist shiny app

1. Create a directory that will contain the app, such as for example
   `"shinyapp"`.
2. In this directory, create the *ui* and *server* files, named `ui.R`
   and `server.R`.
3. In the `ui.R` file, copy and paste the following code, that defines
   a the general UI containing
   - a titel panel with a page title;
   - a page with a sidebar layout, containing a sidebar and a main
     panel;
   - the sidebar panel contains a slider defining the `bins` variable
     (ranging from 1 to 50 with default value of 30);
   - the main panel that plots the `distPlot` figure.

```{r ui1, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app1/ui.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

4. In the `server.R` file, copy and paste the following code, that
   defines the server backend
   - the server is a function that manages an `input` and an `ouput`;
   - the input is the `bins` defined in the *ui* that can be accessed
     with `input$bins`;
   - the outputs are created by assigning `output$distPlot` a value
     with a *render* functon (here `renderPlot`).

```{r server1, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app1/server.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

5. Run the app with `shiny::runApp("shinyapp")` or simply
   `shiny::runApp()` of your working directory is the app dir.

> Challenge

> Run your `shinyapp` application, as described above.

### The shiny infrastructure 

The overview figure below is based and makes reference to lessons of
the [written tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).

### Another shiny app

The *ui* uses the `fluidPage` UI and a sidebar layout. The sidebar
panel contains a `textInput` with a caption, a `selectInput` to choose
from the three possible datasets `rock`, `pressure` or `cars`, and a
`numericInput` to define how many observations to show. 

The main panel use a `textOutput` to display the caption, a
`verbatimOutput` to show the output of the `summary` function on the
data chosen in the `selectInput` above, and a `tableOutput` to show
the head of that same data.

```{r ui2, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app2/ui.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

The *server* defines a `reactive` expression that sets the appropriate
data based on the `selectInput` above. It produces three outputs: 

1. the caption using `renderText` and the caption defined above; 
2. the appropriate summary using `renderPrint` and the reactive data;
3. the table using `renderTable` to produce the head with the reactive
   data and number of observations defined by the `numbericInput`
   above.

```{r shinyapp2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://lgatto.shinyapps.io/shiny-app2/",
                   height = "650px")
```

```{r server2, comment = "", echo=FALSE}
lns <- readLines('src/shiny-app2/server.R')
writeLines(lns[-grep("^\\s*$", lns)])
```

> Challenge
>
> Using the code above, implement and test the app.

### Challenges

> 1. Create an app to visualise the `iris` data where the user can select
>    along which features to view the data.

> 2. As above, where the visualisation is a PCA plot and the user chooses
>    the PCs.
