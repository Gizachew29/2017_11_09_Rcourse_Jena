# Navigating the Bioconductor project


## *biocViews*

Bioconductor has become a large project proposing many packages (1473
software packages at the time of writing) across many domains of high
throughput biology. It continues to grow, at an increasing rate, and
it can be difficult to get started. 

One way to find packages of interest is to navigate the *biocViews*
hierarchy. Every package is tagged with a set of *biocViews*
labels. The highest level defines 3 types of packages:

- Software: packages providing a specific functionality.
- AnnotationData: packages providing annotations, such as various
  ontologies, species annotations, microarray annotations, ...
- ExperimentData: packages distributing experiments.

The *biocViews* page is available here

- https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software
  
It is most easily accessed by clicking on the *software packages* link
on the homepage, under *About Bioconductor*.

## Workflows 

On the other hand, people generally don't approach the Bioconductor
project to learn the whole project, but are interested by a specific
analysis from a Bioconductor package, that they have read in a paper
of interest. In my opinion, it is more effective to restrict ones
attention to a problem or analysis of interest to first immerse
oneself into Bioconductor, then broaden up ones experience to other
topics and packages.

To to that, the project offers workflows that provide a general
introduction to topics such as sequence analysis, annotation
resources, RNA-Seq data analyis, Mass spectrometry and proteomics,
CyTOF analysis, ....

A similar set of resources are published
in [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/) under the Bioconductor
gateway

These peer-reviewed papers describe more complete pipelines involving
one or several packages.

## Learning about specific packages

Each Bioconductor package has it's own *landing pages* that provides
all necessary information about a package, including a short summary,
its current version, the authors, how the cite the package,
installation instructions, and links to all package vignettes. 

Any Bioconductor package page can be contructed by appending the
package's name to `https://bioconductor.org/packages/` to produce an
URL like

- https://bioconductor.org/packages/packagename

This works for any type of package (software, annotation or data). For
example, the pages for packages `r Biocpkg("DESeq2")` or `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` 
would be

- https://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2

and

- https://bioconductor.org/packages/MSnbase

These short URLs are then resolved to their longer form to redirect to
the longer package URL leading the user to the current release version
of the packge.

An important quality of every Bioconductor package is the availability
of a dedicated *vignette*. Vignettes are documentations (generally
provided as pdf or html files) that provide a generic overview of the
package, without necessarily going in detail for every function of the
package.

- Also `knitr::purl`

## Installation

The installation of a Bioconductor package is done using the
`biocLite` function from the `BiocInstaller` package. The first time,
when the package isn't available yet, you need to run

```{r biocLite, eval = FALSE}
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
```

The above command will install and load `r
Biocpkg("BiocInstaller")`. If it isn't loaded yet, first load it with
`library`, then install your package(s) of interest with `biocLite`:

```{r bioLite2, eval = FALSE}
library("BiocInstaller")
biocLite("Biobase")
```

## Challenges

1. Install a Bioconductor package of your choice, discover the
   vignette(s) it offers, open one, and extract the R code of it.

2. Find a package that allows reading raw mass spectrometry data and
   identify the specific function. Either use the *biocViews* tree or
   look for a possible *workflow*.
